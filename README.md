# Rocket Serializer

Rocket Serializer is a Python library that provides serialization capabilities
for OpenRocket files. It allows you to read OpenRocket files using a simple and
intuitive command line interface.

## Installation

You can install Rocket Serializer using pip:

```shell
pip install rocket-serializer
```

## Usage - command line interface

To use Rocket Serializer, you just need to use the cli option of the library.
Here's an example:

```bash
rocket-serializer ork2json --filepath path/to/input.ork --output path/to/output
```

The options are the following:

- `--filepath`: The .ork file to be serialized.
- `--output` : Path to the output folder. If not set, the output will be saved in the same folder os the filepath.
- `--eng` : Path to the engine file. If not set, the library will get the thrust curve from the OpenRocket file.
- `--ork_jar` : Specify the path to the OpenRocket jar file. If not set, the library will try to find the jar file in the current directory.
- `--verbose` : If you want to see the progress of the serialization, set this option to True. By default, it is set to False.

### Limitations

- Only a single nosecone is supported.
- Only a single stage is supported.

### Deserialization

Still to be done.
